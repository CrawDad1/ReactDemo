Before we can begin the project, there are a few things that we'll need to install. 

There are three primary prereqeusites for developing your first program in [[React]]

- [[#Node.js]]
- [[#Yarn]]
- [[#Text Editors]]

## Node.js
Angular uses Node.js for building projects, as well as package management / installation. Install this tool **first**

install Node.js by navigating to the website below and installing the appropriate version for your system:
[Node.js download](https://nodejs.org/en/download)

after installation, it's a good idea to verify proper installation with the following commands.
```
node --version
```
or
```
npm --version
```

if these commands do not work after installation, you may need to restart your CLI window, or perhaps reboot your system. 

## Yarn

## Text Editors
Of course, a reliable and extensible text editor is important for development. This tutorial will move forward with [[Visual Studio Code]] as the primary text editor, but you may choose another angular compatible editor if you have one that you are more comfortable with.
